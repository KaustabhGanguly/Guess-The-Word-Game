# Guess The Word Game
It's a fun project made by me to hone my Python and functional Skills .


There are only 6 words at the moment , but we can connect it to an exetrnal text file containing many words .

The output is interactive and it is built using pure python .

The program runs in an infinite loop , so you can play many times you want without having to run the program many times .
